                <p>We suppose we won’t have to explain why people love computer games. It’s a simple, comfortable, yet also exciting way of spending time. We don’t always have the ability to go out when we want to have some adventure, and this is when electronic devices mean a lot of help, mainly the computer. With their help we get to live through more and more kinds of experiences, without actually having to go through them. This is the reason why games try to capture reality. A lot of people, however, miss the old pixelart games, maybe because it brings back a nice era for them, or because they like the aesthetic of it.</p>
                <p>These games were also easy to learn and to play. Not everyone has the time to get a routine in them, so easy-to-learn games reach a larger target audience than their harder peers.</p>
                <p>Therefore our goal is to create a game which brings a retro vibe with its outlook, is incredibly user friendly, and also demands some ingenuity.</p>
                <p>It will definitely be aMAZEing!</p>

            <h2 onclick="toggleElement('S2C2')">2.2. The problem</h2>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <div class="invisible textContainer" id="S2C2">
                    <p>The foundation of this game lies on a movie titled The Mase Runner, the substance of the movie is to get out of a huge labyrinth starting from a safety clearing at the middle of the labyrinth. At the clearing there is an elevator which brings food and supplies regularly what the player can use to get out. During the navigation throughout the labyrinth the player can meet with monsters anytime which is supposed to prevent the escape.</p>
                    <p>Beside that the labyrinth is changing every night which means new crossovers opens and old ones are closes. This means the player cannot memorize only one layout of the labyrinth, he/she must look for the pattern of the changes. While the player is in the labyrinth, he/she need to watchout for the coming of the night because when the night falls the entrances of the maze are closing of and going to be a lot of monsters in there which means the player has a harder time to get out of there.</p>
                    <p>To solve the problem the player must improve his/her skill of preplanning because he/she has to plan carefully the route based on his/her previous explorations and what will be the possible challenges on that route and what equipment is needed to pass through it and how.</p>
                    <p>Besides the player improves his/her memory as he/she needs to memorize multiple versions of the maze and continuously extending the routes with new sections. This way the player can navigate through any layout of the labyrinth and always know at least one route which is leads out of it but possibly he/she needs alternative routes too so the player can adopt to any new challenge which stands in his/her way and cannot pass it.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the fast reaction time and replanning the route quickly plays really big role during the escape so the player can learn how to find the solution in stressed situations and making good decisions in a short time based on his/her equipment and possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the player improves his/her observation skill because during the playthrough he/she must enter the maze multiple times and watch out for the monsters and memorizing the routes. Besides this, either during the run or after it he/she has to analyse the changes in the labyrinth compared to the previous explorations and try to make conclusions based on that about the changing patterns so he/she can lower the amount of information what he/she need to remember.</p>
                    <p>In total, this game highly improves quick thinking, memory, strategy and reaction time. This way the player can improve these skills in a more relaxing way. These skills are also really useful in the real world. We have to make quick decisions based on our observations and our conclusions every day. And it makes our day so much easier when we can plan it out previously as much as possible.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, if we can remember at least a section of a new route then we do not have to stop so often to check it on a map or ask someone. The first advantage of it is that we can find our way back and the second is that the journey will be shorter which is pretty good in today’s world.</p>
                    <p>In addition, if the known way is blocked for some reason, that is an advantage when we know alternative routes, so we do not run into the previous problem.</p>
                    <p>To sum up with, this game is improving those skills which are very useful every day and makes us less lost in every part of our lives.</p>

                    <p>Made for gamers who enjoy action-adventure games and solving puzzles.</p>
                    <p>The game will be enjoyed by fans of the Maze Runner movies and those who like games with a similar theme. The target audience for the game is mainly teenagers and young adults.</p>
                    <p>The game is an action-adventure video game that contains similar elements to the world of the Maze Runner movies, but is not a faithful adaptation.</p>
                    <p>The basic benefit is the fun experience of the game, which allows players to solve similar puzzles and perform similar actions as in the movies. The game offers a similar, exciting experience for Maze Runner fans, but with unique characters and story.</p>
                    <p>Alternatives:</p>
                    <p>Existing other systems: Other similarly themed games that are not based on the Maze Runner movies, but contain similar survival and mystery-solving elements, such as "The Forest" or "Raft."</p>
                    <p>Alternatives: Alternatives may include games that are in the action-adventure genre but have a different theme, such as fantasy or science-fiction worlds.</p>
                    <p>The finished game will differ from the alternatives with a world and story inspired by the Maze Runner movies. While not a faithful adaptation, the game gives players the opportunity to engage in an adventure with a similar atmosphere to the movies. The game also features unique characters and events, so it may appeal to those who are not necessarily fans of the Maze Runner series.</p>

                    <p>Our aim is to make our game as widely accessible as possible, but to do this the devices running the game must meet certain technical requirements.
                        To ensure a smooth gaming experience on different platforms, we have defined some basic system requirements.</p>
                    <p><b>Mobile (Android and iOS):</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPU: quad-core processor running at 2.0 GHz or higher</li>
                        <li>RAM: Minimum 3 GB</li>
                        <li>Minimum 2 GB of free storage space</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>PC:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPU: quad-core processor running at 2.0 GHz or higher</li>
                        <li>RAM: Minimum 3 GB</li>
                        <li>Video Card: NVIDIA GTX 1050 or equivalent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Meeting these requirements is essential to run the game optimally. Device performance and capacity are closely linked to the gaming experience. However, system specifications not only affect the way the game runs, but also the graphics quality and load time.</p>
                    <p>Hosting is also an important consideration. For mobile devices, the game takes up about 1 GB of space, while for PCs, you need at least 10 GB of free space to install the full game. In addition, future updates and additions may require additional storage space.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note that the newer and more powerful the device, the better the gaming experience. For outdated or less powerful devices, it is possible to run the game, but users should not expect the highest graphics settings and fastest load times.</p>
                    <p>These system requirements and guidelines will help users to decide if the device they are using is suitable for the game and what performance they can expect on the platform.</p>

                <p>The product is an adventure and survival videogame inspired by the 2014 movie The Maze Runner. It features 2D graphics – from a top-down perspective – and gameplay elements from roguelike videogames, namely permadeath and procedurally generated levels.</p>
                <p>The game features two game modes – story mode and endless mode. While the core gameplay is the same in these two game modes, they differ in the end goal of the player.</p>
                <p>The objective of the game in story mode is to survive long enough to thoroughly explore and, ultimately, escape the maze. The player can encounter various hostile creatures throughout their adventure. It is up to the player to fight them or run away from them. Friendly NPCs can also be encountered, who may be willing to trade items with the player or offer useful advice. The survival aspect of the game involves thirst and hunger, meaning the player must eat and drink to survive, while having to find shelter for the night and defend themselves from hostile creatures. The day-night cycle is simulated in the game – one in-game hour is one minute in real time. The night can be skipped by sleeping in a safe place. It is more dangerous to explore the maze at night, as enemies are encountered in much greater numbers. As time goes on and days pass in-game, survival will become more challenging, as the player will face more and stronger enemies.</p>
                <p>In endless mode, the player cannot escape the maze. Instead, they have to focus on surviving as many days as possible. To unlock endless mode, the player must complete story mode at least once.</p>
                <p>The levels consist of a safe clearing in the middle, surrounded by a maze. The layout of the maze is altered each time an in-game day passes. In the clearing, there is an elevator which brings food, weapons and other supplies required for survival on a regular basis. Items can also be found within the maze itself.</p>
                <p>In both game modes, the player can choose from multiple playable characters. These characters differ in their numerical stats – such as amount of hit points and movement speed – and their unique abilities. The player can gain XP by defeating enemies and progressing through the game – if enough XP is gathered, it is possible to level up. When leveling up, the player can choose which stat(s) of their character they want to improve. The leveling system is not exclusive to the player, however. As time passes, the hostile creatures the player faces will also be at higher levels. This means that even enemy types first encountered in the beginning of the game can still be a legitimate threat in later stages of the player’s adventure. Higher level monsters have more hit points, deal more damage, and may even gain new abilities at certain levels.</p>
                <p>The player’s progress is automatically saved each time they quit the game, and can be loaded when they start it up again. Alternatively, a new playthrough can be started without discarding previous progress. This is useful if multiple people use the same computer, and each of them want to start their own playthrough. In story mode, players can also manually save and load their progress. This is not possible in endless mode however, in order to ensure the appropriate difficulty of the game mode. If the player dies in endless mode, the save file for that playthrough is permanently deleted.</p>
                <p>An options menu is also available, where the players can customize their experience with the game. In this menu it is possible to rebind controls, adjust audio volume and change the resolution.</p>

               <p>There will be different endings depending on the way the user plays the game. We will make sure, that all story lines will be immersive, and give an exceptional time for those who like to get lost in the story</p>

                <p>The main risk factor in our case is the lack of time, because at the university we have a lot of work to do. This can be solved by the right distribution of the tasks and the exact definition of deadlines. Even if we got stuck working on some functions, there’s still the possibility to give it up or to ask for help.</p>
