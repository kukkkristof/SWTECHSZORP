            </p>
            <h1>4. FIRST STEPS</h1>

            <h1>6. CHARACTERS</h1>
            <p>The player can choose between a variaty of playable characters. These differ in their numerical stats, such as hit points or speed. The player gets XP from defeating enemies and progressing in the game. With the right amount of XP, the character can level up, and the player can choose which of their ability to improve. By the character leveling up, the hostile creatures also level up. Higher level creatures can cause more damage and can also develop new abilities.

            <h1>7. STORY MODE</h1>
            <p>In this mode the goal is to explore the maze, and to escape it. Lots of hostile creatures can prevent that, it's up to the player wether he/she fights with them or kills them. There are also friendly NPCs, they can give advice and make trades. The character also needs to eat, drink, find shelter for the night, and defend themselves from hostile creatures to survive. It's more dangerous to wander around at night as enemies will appear more frequently. As time goes by, it'll be harder to survive due to stronger and more enemies.
            </p>
            <h1>8. ENDLESS MODE</h1>
            <p>In this mode you can not escape the maze, the goal is to survive for as long as possible. This mode is only available after playing story mode.
            </p>
            <h1>9. SAVE</h1>
            <p>The game can handle multiple saves, before starting playing the player will be asked which one does he/she want to continue. This is advantegous when multiple people are using the same device. The progress is automatically saved when quitting the game, but players can also save and load saves manually (except in endless mode).
