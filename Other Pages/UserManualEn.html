                <h1>1. INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>
                    The program is an adventure survivor game inspired by the movie Maze Runner. In this story a teenage boy wakes up in an old rusty elevator, remembering nothing. Reaching the surface, he finds himself on a big plain filled with grass, called "The Glade". This is a big closed square surrounded by tall stone walls. Food and equipment is delivered regularly by the elevator.
                </p>
                <p>
                Soon it turns out that our hero's goal is to escape, because the gates on the square-shaped Glade's walls aren't exits but entrances to a so far unsolved labyrinth. What makes it harder to solve the labyrinth is it can only be explored during the day, as in the night it is dominated by biomechanic monsters ("Grievers"). (The routes aren't exactly safe from them in the day either.) The gates connecting the maze and the glade close every evening, and whoever stays in the labyrinth for the night, most likely won't survive until they open in the morning. Another difficulty is that sometimes the layout of the labyrinth changes during the night, closing or opening new entrances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the game you'll explore the maze and the creatures in it through various dangerous and exciting situations. We guarantee a form of relaxation in which one can improve their logical, problem solving and concentrating skills.

                    In this mode the goal is to explore the maze, and to escape it. Lots of hostile creatures can prevent that, it's up to the player wether he/she fights with them or kills them. There are also friendly NPCs, they can give advice and make trades. The character also needs to eat, drink, find shelter for the night, and defend themselves from hostile creatures to survive. It's more dangerous to wander around at night as enemies will appear more frequently. As time goes by, it'll be harder to survive due to stronger and more enemies.

                    The player can choose between a variaty of playable characters. These differ in their numerical stats, such as hit points or speed, their equipment and their abilities. The player gets XP from defeating enemies and progressing in the game. With the right amount of XP, the character can level up, and the player can choose which of their ability to improve. We recommend improving the main abilities (listed below) because that's the most benefitable for each character.

                    By the character leveling up, the hostile creatures also level up. Higher level creatures can cause more damage and can also develop new abilities.

                <p>
                    One of the best source of nutrients there is. It is consumable cooked, it is possible to make flour out of it, and therefore other baked goods too.

                <h3>BANANA</h3>
                <p>
                    The most filling fruit, with one banana you can last hours long before having to eat again.

                <h3>MUSHROOM</h3>
                <p>
                    You have to look closely before eating. From its consumable form you can make great dishes, especially with Frypan.
                </p>

                <h3>APPLE</h3>
                <p>

                    The game can handle multiple saves, before starting playing the player can choose which one does he/she want to continue in the main menu > “LOAD GAME”. This is advantegous when multiple people are using the same device. The progress is automatically saved when quitting the game, but players can also save and load saves manually by clicking the gear wheel in the upper right corner (except in endless mode).
