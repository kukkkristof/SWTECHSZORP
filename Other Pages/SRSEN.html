    <section id="Introduction">
        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Here at SZORP we are creating a survival-adventure game where any type of player can have a good time.
        </p>
        <p>
            SZORP is a game, where the player is put in a plains surrounded by a maze, and the goal is to escape the maze.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the game the player will uncover secrets about the maze, and will find interesting side stories to complete,
            all while getting stronger and levelling up as the days go by.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Overview">
        <h1>2. Overview</h1>
        <p>
        While thinking about the game, we realized, that not many games offer this type of gameplay. The game is largely based on the movie
        "The Maze Runner"
        <h3>
            Use-case of the game:
        </h3>
        <img class="UseCase" src="../Images/Usecase.jpg" alt="Use Case Diagram" title="Use Case Diagram">
        <p>Note: All visual representations(except the use-case) are made with Godot Engine!</p>

        <h1>3. Specific requirements</h1>

        <h2>3.1. Game Manager</h2>
        <p>
            The game manager component manages the map generation, objects that work with time(Effects, Entities, Crops, Spawners), save files and settings.
            This is an essential part of the game, since there are many parts that are needed to be connected.
        </p>
        <h3>MAP GENERATION:</h3>
        <p>The survival map is generated with Perlin Noise, where at every x and y position is a number between 0.0 and 1.0, which can be used as a heightmap, and different tiles can be associated.</p>
        <img src="../Images/PerlinNoise.png" alt="Image of Perlin noise">
        <p>
            The maze map has a unique generation where we select two points, 'END' and 'START' and generates random checkpoints where the generator needs to create a path to.
            It can be called 'k' times, and with a perfect combination it generates a great random maze.
            This number is yet to be determined by testing multiple scenarios, for each maze sizes!
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/MazeGeneration.png" alt="Image of Maze Generation steps">
        <h3>TIME MANAGEMENT:</h3>
        <p>
            In the Game Manager there should be a function that is called at every frame and knows the passed time, this method is the Godot Engines built in Update method which has an argument
            named delta, which is the time between the current and the previous frame in seconds. With this variable we can check for "ticks" which are updates called every 't' seconds.
            At every tick, we check if any crops should grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also loop around every timed object at every frame, for each we call a method that passes time in said object, for every type of object that is timed, this function is different. Explained
            further on the affected object definitions.
        </p>

        <h3>SETTINGS:</h3>
        <p>The settings are saved in the games directory, in a directory named 'UserData', with the filename 'settings.json' . This files structure is the following:</p>
        <p>"Graphics": float (0.0 - 1.0),</p>
        <p>"Sound": float (0.0 - 1.0),</p>
        <p>"MaxEntityCount": int (100 - 300),</p>
        <p>"Colorblind": int (0 - 3),</p>
        <p>"SoundText": boolean (true, false)</p>

        <h2>Timed Objects</h2>

        <p>
            In the expansive landscape of game development, the incorporation of Timed Objects stands as a hallmark approach, introducing a layer of sophistication that seamlessly adapts to the nuances of diverse hardware configurations. This architectural choice, centered around real-time intervals, not only ensures reliability but also guarantees a consistent and engaging player experience, irrespective of the underlying device's frame rate variations.
        </p>
        <h3>Attributes and Methodology:</h3>
        <p>
            Each Timed Object, a cornerstone of this dynamic framework, boasts a distinct attribute denoting the precise moment of its creation. Augmented by a method crafted with precision, this design philosophy transcends the conventional reliance on frame-dependent mechanisms, fortifying the game's foundation and fostering an immersive, reliable, and universally accessible environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Categories of Timed Objects:</h3>
        <p>The hierarchical arrangement of Timed Objects unfolds with four pivotal classes: Entities, Crops, Spawners, and Effects.</p>

        <h3>Entities:</h3>
        Entities, the pulse of the game's narrative, are further diversified into various types, each encapsulating unique behaviors tied intricately to the passage of time.

        <h4>Player:</h4>
        <p>
            The Player entity, the central protagonist, anchors the player's journey. Beginning in a tranquil plains setting, the Player embarks on a quest through a challenging maze. This dynamic entity is at the heart of the player's interaction with the game world, evolving as time passes.

    <section id="Usability">
        <h1>4. Usability</h1>
        <p>
            In this gripping and immersive gaming experience, players will find themselves thrust into the heart of a labyrinthine world.
            The game's usability is designed to seamlessly blend excitement with strategic thinking, as players navigate through intricate mazes filled with suspenseful
            twists and turns. Intuitive controls and a user-friendly interface ensure that both novice and experienced gamers can easily delve into the adrenaline-pumping action.
            Engaging puzzles, dynamic obstacles, and a captivating storyline enhance the overall usability, creating an unforgettable gaming adventure.
        </p>
        <h2>4.1. Learning Curve</h2>
        <p>
            Our game has a pretty easy learning curve, so it is easy to get started anytime for younger and older folks too. Our goal was to create a game that is enjoyable and does not provide too much difficulty, however
            the player can decide to enter  a harder difficulty, where things are not as simple, those game modes even have their unique elements, so their curve is steeper but still on the easier side.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Reliability">
        <h1>5. Reliability</h1>
        <p>
            Since this is an offline game, after installation there should not be any downtime, so you can play any time you want to. If at any point the player encounters a bug where they cannot start
            the game, we are easy to reach to fix that bug as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our response usually takes 12 hours maximum on weekdays, and the average bugfix is about 1 hour, so the time the player cannot play  is roughly 13 hours (MTTR = 13 hours), but it should happen about once a month maximum (MTBF = 1 month).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Performance">
        <h1>6. Performance</h1>
        <p>FPS / CPU: We aim to achieve 60 FPS on low-end hardware to make it more accessible, currently a 2.4 GHz 4 core CPU is enough for our calculations in the current state of the game.</p>
        <p>Memory: With our texture sizes(32*32) relatively few memory is reserved for textures, and with the maximum amount of entities allowed in our game, the maximum memory usage is 500MB.</p>
        <p>Disk space: The game does not take up that many space on the storage devices, it is currently 120 MB at this rate the end product will approximately will be 250 MB</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Supportability">
        <h1>7. Supportability</h1>
        <p>
            With us documenting every development step, and our code is easy to read thanks to famous coding conventions, development in the future will be easy for those, who plan on modding and/or developing the game further.
        </p>
        <p>
            Error Managing: C# has a robust exception handler, so if at any point an error occurs in the system, the user gets notified and if they decide to, they can send us the error message for diagnostic reasons, since
            the default error manager writes in great detail about the exception.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every crash report is stored in the games' directory, if the player wants to they can read back at any time what were their crashes.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="DesignConstrains">
        <h1>8. Design Constrains</h1>
        <p>
            Plagiarism: We don't want to full-on copy the Maze Runner movie it just gave us an idea that we really clicked with. However, it might not be our intentions some elements might be too similar, so we have to rework those
            elements for it not to be like in the movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hardware limitations: We would like to create a bigger and more detailed world for our game, but unfortunately it would be too resource heavy on all computers, now we use a 128*128 world which is large enough, but
            we think if we took it up to 1024^1024 it would be a better experience. That is sadly not can not be done since it even runs slow on our computers, so we cant test with those.
        </p>
        <p>
            Language limitations: C# is great for many things, but it is an object-oriented programming language so many elements are taking up more resources than they should be, so in larger scales it slows down the game,
            this is partly the reason for the map size we said in the hardware limitations section. It is not the main reason, but it does not help. Lookups are slower, but calculations run faster than in other languages
            (Based on our testing, with code snippets from the game), so we stick with this language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time limitations: Due to exams coming up, our development progress in the game greatly decreased, since we have lots of classes to study for, this in itself hugely impacts the speed the game is getting developed, and
            our attempts at rushed development just took us backwards in the project.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Standards">
        <h1>9. Applicable Standards</h1>
        <p>
            During the development we opted for PascalCase and Snake_Case to make our code more readable, we also avoided recursion for safer code.
